# Resistance to Cane Toad Toxin Introduced in Cells of the Fat-Tailed Dunnart

<span style="font-size: 3em; line-height: 0.8em; vertical-align: top; float: left; margin-right: 10px;">I</span>n 1935 cane toads, *Bufo marinus*, were brought to Australia from Hawaii (whereto they had been brought from Puerto Rico): deployed to fight cane beetles in the expanding sugar cane fields of Queensland on the north-eastern Australian coast.[^1] The toads proliferated happily in fish-less ponds, spread north-west and became a serious threat to carnivorous marsupials that would feed on them, oblivious to the deadly bufotoxin produced in glands of the stout amphibian.[^2] The toxin kills by inhibiting the function of N<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase membrane proteins, necessary for maintaining the electrical potential across nerve cells.[^3] Now, [a new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.07.591791v1) from scientists at the University of Melbourne and Colossal Biosciences report the successful introduction of bufotoxin resistance into cultured skin cells (*fibroblasts*) of the fat-tailed dunnart, *dasyuri dunni*, a small marsupial carnivore, endemic to Australia and used as a model organism for marsupial development research. The genetic modification, introduced using CRISPR, changed the sequence of the domain of N<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase targeted by bufotoxin to resemble the one found in a bufotoxin-resistant lizard. The succesfully transfected cells were heterozygous for the new variant as shown by DNA sequencing of the targeted segment of the ATP1A1 gene, and could withstand 45 times higher concentrations of bufotoxin than the untransfected wildtype cells before surcombing.[^4]

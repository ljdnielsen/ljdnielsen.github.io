## Resistance to Cane Toad Toxin Introduced in Cells of the Fat-Tailed Dunnart

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n 1935 cane toads (*Bufo marinus*) were brought to Australia from Hawaii, where they had been introduced from Puerto Rico. They were deployed to combat cane beetles in the expanding sugar cane fields of Queensland on Australia's northeast coast.[^1] The toads proliferated readily in fish-less ponds, spread northwest, and became a serious threat to carnivorous marsupials that would feed on them oblivious to the deadly bufotoxin produced in their glands.[^2] The toxin kills by inhibiting the function of N<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase membrane proteins which are necessary for maintaining the electrical potential across nerve cells.[^3]

Now, [a new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.07.591791v1) from scientists at the University of Melbourne and Colossal Biosciences, a US biotech start-up, reports the successful introduction of bufotoxin resistance into cultured skin cells (fibroblasts) of the fat-tailed dunnart (*Sminthopsis crassicaudata*), a small marsupial carnivore endemic to Australia and used as a model organism for marsupial development research. The genetic modification, introduced using CRISPR-Cas gene editing, changed the sequence of the domain of N<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase targeted by bufotoxin, to resemble the sequence found in a bufotoxin-resistant lizard. The succesfully transfected cells were heterozygous for the new variant, as shown by DNA sequencing of the targeted segment of the ATP1A1 N<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene, and could withstand 45 times higher concentrations of bufotoxin than the untransfected wild-type cells before succombing.[^4]

## Scientists Infer the Behaviour of the Thylacine from Bone and Teeth Size and Strength Ratios

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n a paper published in the Journal of Zoology, scientists Menna E. Jones and D. Michael Stoddart describe how they infered the running speed and prey-size range of the thylacine, by using bone or teeth ratio-to-trait models. A comparison of the ratio of the femur (thigh bone) to the metatarsal bone (the bone between the heel and the ball of the foot) of 4 thylacine skeletons with that of other mammalian predators, placed the thylacine with tasmanian devils and badgers in respect to running speed, indicating that the thylacine was a slow animal. It's canines strength profile, measured as the ratio of canine strength in antero-posterior (front-to-back) and medio-lateral (side-to-side) direction, was similar to that of modern hyenas, and rarely fractured compared with the teeth of quolls as measured by the ratio of the observed to expected number of fractured teeth in the sample collection.

The elongated mussel of the thylacine, a characteristic similar to that of the red fox, and different from that of the gray wolf, suggests that the thylacine hunted small prey, which does not require great strength in the front of the mouth, but instead can be killed by grapping and shaking them like foxes do. This corresponds with skeletal remains from caves featuring thylacine fossils together with smaller prey. This does not rule out that the thylacine, like hyenas, hunted large prey in packs, leaving the prey where it was killed. But according to accounts of the animal spotted in the wild, it was a soletary predator and not seen in packs.

The scientists conclude that the thylacine was not an ambush or stalking predator, but a pounce-pursuit predator, similar to tasmanian devils or quolls, that hunted prey smaller than 1/5th of its own size, that is, with a mass of ~1-5kg.[^1]

## Scientists Infer the Behaviour of the Thylacine from Bone and Teeth Structure Ratios

Based on models mapping the ratios of leg bones, particularly the femur to metatarsal length, with running speed, scientists Menna E. Jones and D. Michael Stoddart infered that the thylacine was a slow runner, similar to the Tasmanian devil. It's canines strength profile, measured as the ratio of canine strength in antero-posterior (front-to-back) and medio-lateral (side-to-side) direction, was similar to that of modern hyenas, and rarely fractured compared with the teach of quolls as measured by the ratio of observed to expected number of fractured teath in the sample collection.

The elongated mussel of the thylacine, a characteristic similar to that of the red fox, and very different from that of the gray wolf, suggest that the thylacine hunted small prey, which does not require great strength in the front of the mouth but can be killed by grapping and shaking. This corresponds with fossils from caves storing thylacine fossils together with small prey of 1-5kg. This does not rule out that the thylacine, like hyenas, hunted large prey in packs, leaving the prey where it was killed. But according to accounts of the animal in the wild, it was a soletary predator.[^1]

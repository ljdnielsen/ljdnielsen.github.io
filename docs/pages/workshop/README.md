## Transcription Factor Binding Affinity Linearly Correlates with the Number of Fingers in Mice

The Shh gene is responsible for digit development through its expression in the Zone of Polarizing Activity region, in the developing limb bud, during embryonic development in mice and humans. It is controlled by an enhancer region called ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS) which has multiple transcription factor binding sites. One of these transcription factor binding sites, ETS-A, is associated with known SNVs causing polydactyly (having more than five fingers) in humans.

In a research paper published January 2024 in the prominent journal Nature, Emma Farley and colleagues measured the binding affinity of the ETS-1 to the binding sites of ZRS. They found that the pathogenic mutations causing polydactyly increase the binding affinity of ETS-1 to the binding site ETS-A. They then created alternative ETS-A mutant variants, different from the known SNVs causing polydactyly, but with the same increased binding affinity, and showed that they resulted in the same phenotypic change, establishing that it is the increased binding affinity of the ETS-A site that casuses the change in phenotype associated with the known mutations.

To establish that the change in phenotype stems from an increased expression of shh in the affected tissues, the authors measured gene expression of affinity-enhanced mutants in cell-lines of limb cells. This was difficult to show suggesting that increased binding affinity might only have caused a slight increase in expression, that none-the-less was sufficient to drive the increased number of digits.

The authors then went on to show that of all the SNVs known to cause phenotypic changes in humans, the majority are mutations that increase binding affinity of transcription factors to enhancers.[^1]

## Cis-Regulatory Convergence Between Thylacine and Gray Wolf Craniofacial Cytokine Expression

Feigin and colleagues from the Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research lab at the University of Melbourne show in a paper from 2019 published in Genome Research, that non-coding regulatory sequences controlling the expression of cytokines, cell signalling molecules controlling the differentiation of cells, have undergone similar accelerated evolution in both thylacines and gray wolf.

The researchers behind the paper homed in on the identified loci using multiple computational filtering steps. First they isolatated cis-regulatory sequences expressed in the face conserved, that is with orthologues, across all vertebrates, to get sequences that can be subject to evolution of craniofacial morphology through sequence change in the first place. Then they reduced that set to sequences experimentally or clinically verified in mouse or human to affect skull development. Finally this set of loci were reduced to sequenced that had been subject to positive selection in thylacines (TARs), in gray wolfs (WARs), or in both (TWARS).

To understand the role of the TWARs, loci of convergent evolutionary rates involved in craniofacial morphology, the authors summarized the ontology, that is the presumed function, of the genes in the TWARs neighborhood. This analysis revealed that convergent evolution between thylacine and gray wolf craniofacial evolution had targeted cytokines involved in snout, skull cap, muscle, and nerve cell development.

The identified loci control cell signalling and transcription regulation prompting further investigation into how the identified sequence changes has affected transcription factor binding affinity or other functional molecular characteristics.[^2]
